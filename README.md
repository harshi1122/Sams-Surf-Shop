# Sams-Surf-Shop

Project Overview

Welcome to Sam’s Surf Shop! 

You’ve been hired to create a handful of tests for the shopping cart software at the surf shop. Once that is done, you’ll implement some improvements for these tests using more advanced unit testing features (skipping, parameterization, and expected failures). Finally, you’ll have the opportunity to fix bugs that were exposed by your tests.
